Source files: GFXMath.h, GFXMath_Test.cpp, Makefile

How to run: 
	1) Navigate into folder with source files with the terminal.
	2) Use command "make" to build all necessary source files.
	3) Use command "./GFXMath_Test" to run the program.

Purpose: This program contains definitions and speficiations for useful vector math functions.
	 The program built from these files tests those functions.

	 The program has confirmed that all tests have passed, and they should all pass no matter
	 who tests the program and what machine he/she runs it on.

External dependencies: Files in the "config" folder, provided with the homework.
